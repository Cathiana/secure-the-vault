Assign three variables. Each variable contains the corresponding result of calculation using a unique arithmetic operator. Each must equal one of the three codes in the combination.
Add comments throughout the code to explain each step in the process.
Create a dialog box displaying the vault codes and the text if using HTML and a script tag, or create a popup dialog.
Please submit either a file with your code or a screenshot of the code, with the pseudocode showing, or a GitHub link.
